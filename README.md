# Cypress Todo Demo

This repo is meant to demonstrate how to write different types of
[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) tests by testing the
[TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) app.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required. If using
[NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) you can run `$ nvm use` to automatically
switch to the correct version of Node.

## Installation

1. Install all Node packages including Cypress.

```shell
$ npm ci
```

2. Start the server.

```shell
$ npm start
```

3. Open the Cypress GUI with another terminal window.

```shell
$ npm run cypress
```

## [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) â€¢ Vanilla ES6

> A port of the [Vanilla JS Example](http://todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/),
> but translated into ES6, also known as ES2015.
